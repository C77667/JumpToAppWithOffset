/*
  Jump to Application With Offset in Flash - based on Blink example
  Turns on an LED on for one second, off for one second, then on again
  for one more second before setting some peripherals back to their reset
  state and jumping to address 0x8080 in flash.

  Intended to be used with uTasker project to have a program capable of
  USB-MSD coexisting in the Teensy's flash with an Arduino program

  This example code is in the public domain.
